I'm a PhD student at the chemoinformatics research group at the Information School, University of Sheffield.

*Project title*: Development of novel techniques for assessing bioisosteric similarity of chemical fragments
*Supervisors*: Professor Val Gillet (_Information School, University of Sheffield_), David Cosgrove (_AstraZeneca_) and Martin Packer (_AstraZeneca_).

## Research Interests
- Non-rigid geometry of molecular shape. In particular, spectral and diffusion geometry for isometric shape description. This incorporates areas of computational geometry and algebraic topology.

- I have a general interest in chemoinformatics, computational drug design, statistics, machine learning, and probabilistic modelling.

## Other Interests
- Linux
- HPC with Python
- Big Data on distributed systems: Cloudera, Hadoop, Spark, Pig, etc.

## Real World
In the real world, I like to spend my spare time running and racing in the fells and moorland of the North of England.
